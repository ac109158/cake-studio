<p>Mary Lou’'s Cake Studio specializes in custom designed edible works of art -– whether it's for a wedding, birthday, baby shower or just a day to be made special. The quality and attention to detail starts from the inside out - from the choice of ingredients, down to delicate handmade gumpaste flowers and decorations.

Every cake is a unique collaboration between client and designer, custom tailored to suit your personal tastes and style.  Designs are first sketched and start with simple ideas such as– a color scheme, a theme, or photos of things you love. My goal is to create a work of art that tastes as spectacular as it looks.
